# privacy_policy.txt — Twitch Tab Manager
Last updated: 18 September 2025

Summary
Twitch Tab Manager runs locally in your browser to open/close Twitch tabs based on who is live, and (optionally) resume/unmute playback. We do not collect, sell, or share personal data. The extension does not use analytics, advertising, or any developer-controlled servers.

What the extension does
- Reads local configuration (either from Options storage, or optional files like config.json and follows.txt).
- Uses Twitch’s official Helix API (from your browser) or the Following → Live page (HTML fallback) to determine who is live.
- Can temporarily open the Following → Channels page as an active tab, auto-scroll it to read your followed usernames, then close it and restore your previous tab.
- Opens/closes Twitch tabs for channels that are live, and injects a local helper script on twitch.tv to resume/unmute playback.

Data we process
- Local-only configuration: values such as client_id, locally-generated access_token, feature toggles, and your follows list. These remain on your device unless you export or share them.
- Local runtime state: minimal flags (enabled/disabled), last poll time, and de-duplication state stored via extension storage.
- Network requests: your browser talks directly to twitch.tv and api.twitch.tv over HTTPS.

We do NOT collect
- Account credentials
- Browsing history outside twitch.tv
- Personal identifiers sent to the developer
- Advertising IDs
- Any sale or sharing of data with third parties

Permissions (why we need them)
- tabs — open/close Twitch tabs and prevent duplicates.
- storage — save the on/off toggle and minimal state (locally).
- alarms — periodic background polling (MV3 service worker heartbeat).
- scripting — inject a small helper (content_unmute.js) into twitch.tv to resume/unmute playback.
- host_permissions (twitch.tv only) — required to interact with Twitch pages.

Cookies & local storage
The extension does not set tracking cookies. Limited state is stored using the browser’s extension storage (local to your device).

Children’s privacy
This extension is not directed to children under 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information.

Security
- All Twitch API calls use HTTPS.
- Your tokens and follows remain local.
- Do not publish your Client Secret or access token publicly; rotate tokens if exposed.

Data retention & deletion
All data is local. To remove it, delete the optional files, clear the extension’s storage (Options → Reset to Packaged / browser extension settings), or uninstall the extension.

Changes to this policy
This policy may be updated to reflect improvements or Chrome Web Store requirements. The “Last updated” date will be revised accordingly.

Store Listing — Permissions Rationale
This extension only operates on twitch.tv:
- tabs: open/close stream tabs and dedupe
- storage: local preferences and state
- alarms: periodic checks
- scripting: unmute/resume helper on twitch.tv
- host_permissions (twitch.tv only): required for page interaction

Store Listing — Short Privacy Blurb
We don’t collect, sell, or share personal data. All configuration stays on your device. The extension talks directly to Twitch over HTTPS and never sends data to developer-controlled servers.
