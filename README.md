# Twitch Tab Manager

Opens Twitch stream tabs for your followed channels, tries to keep them playing, avoids duplicates, and respects a max tab limit.

Main goal: help manage Twitch tabs automatically without messing with tabs you opened yourself.

- Auto-open and auto-close Twitch channel tabs based on **live status**
- **Helix-first** live detection when `client_id` + `access_token` are configured
- HTML fallback/live probing for setups that do not use Helix
- Per-channel **de-duplication**
- Keeps Twitch tabs together in the same browser window where possible
- Respects a strict **max tab cap** (`max_tabs`)
- Background **re-pokes** managed Twitch tabs to help resume playback/unmute when Twitch stalls hidden tabs
- Popup controls for:
  - **On / Off**
  - **Force Poll**
  - **Reload Config**
  - **Open Settings**
  - **Diagnose**
- Options page includes:
  - JSON config editor

---

## Requirements
- **Chrome** or another Chromium-based browser with **Developer Mode**
- For best live detection, a Twitch **Client ID** + **App Access Token**
- Token-less setups can still work through HTML/fallback methods, but Helix is preferred

## Quick Start

1. Open `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable **Developer mode**
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select this extension folder
5. Open the popup and turn it **On**
6. Open **Settings**
7. Check your config / follows / priority
8. Use **Fetch My Follows** if needed
9. Use **Force Poll** to test immediately

---

## Settings

Settings are stored locally. Typical example:

```json
{
  "live_source": "auto",
  "client_id": "",
  "access_token": "",
  "check_interval_sec": 60,
  "max_tabs": 4,
  "enabled": true,
  "force_unmute": false,
  "unmute_streams": true,
  "force_resume": false,
  "autoplay_streams": true,
  "follows": [],
  "priority": [],
  "followUnion": [],
  "blacklist": [],
  "soft_wake_tabs": false,
  "soft_wake_only_when_browser_focused": true
}
```

### Notes

* `live_source: "auto"` prefers Helix first, then falls back when needed
* `priority` is separate from `follows`
* `followUnion` is the combined set used internally
* `max_tabs` is always enforced
* `soft_wake_tabs` is meant for harder cases where Twitch background tabs stay paused/muted
* `soft_wake_only_when_browser_focused` is meant to avoid interrupting games or other apps

---

## Fetch My Follows

The Options page supports two fetch modes:

* **Open active tab (auto-scroll)**
  Opens the official `Following → Channels` page, scrolls it, and saves the usernames found there.

* **Use my current Twitch tab**
  Reuses an already-open Twitch tab and moves it to the correct page if needed before scraping.

### Current behavior

* Newly fetched follows are synced into your stored `follows`
* Channels you no longer follow can be removed during sync
* `priority` is left alone
* `followUnion` is rebuilt from `follows + priority`

### Planned improvement

* clearer follow sync changelog in the UI
* better visibility for “added” and “removed” usernames after a fetch

---

## Get `client_id` & `access_token`

### Create a Twitch app

* Go to the Twitch Developer Console
* Register an application
* A placeholder redirect like `http://localhost` is fine for this use
* Copy your **Client ID**
* Keep your **Client Secret** private

### Generate an App Access Token

**PowerShell (Windows)**

```powershell
$client_id = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE"
$client_secret = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE"
$body = @{
  client_id     = $client_id
  client_secret = $client_secret
  grant_type    = "client_credentials"
}
$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri "https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/token" -Body $body
$response | Format-List
```

**curl**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/token" \
  -d "client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE" \
  -d "client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE" \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials"
```

> If Helix starts returning 401 errors, generate a new token.

## How It Works

The background worker checks who is live, compares that against already open Twitch tabs, and then opens or closes its own managed tabs as needed.

To help with Twitch being Twitch, managed tabs can also get a few extra nudges after opening to help playback resume or stay active.

It should only auto-close tabs that the extension opened itself.

There is also some extra safety logic so a bad Twitch response or temporary empty live result does not instantly make it close everything.

---

## Usage

### Popup

* **On / Off** — master toggle
* **Force Poll** — run a live check immediately
* **Reload Config** — reload settings in the background worker
* **Open Settings** — jump to Options
* **Diagnose** — quick status/debug info

### Options

* **Settings JSON**

  * Save
  * Apply & Reload
  * Export
  * Import
  * Reset to Packaged
  * Refresh From Storage
* **Follows**

  * Save
  * Export
  * Import
  * Reset to Packaged
  * Refresh From Storage
  * Fetch My Follows
* **Priority Channels**

  * manual list of preferred channels
* **Debug**

  * diagnostics
  * logs
  * helper actions

---

## Troubleshooting

### No tabs open

* Check that the extension is turned **On**
* Check that `follows` or `priority` is not empty
* If using Helix, verify `client_id` and `access_token`
* Try **Force Poll**

### Force Poll finds lives but opens nothing

* Check Diagnostics
* Check `max_tabs`
* Make sure those channels are not already open in duplicate/problem tabs
* Reload the extension and try again

### Tabs open but stay paused or muted

* Twitch background behavior can be inconsistent
* Re-pokes should help, but some cases may still require a visible/focused tab
* `soft_wake_tabs` exists for future / advanced handling, but should stay conservative

### Fetch My Follows misses channels

* Use the official `Following → Channels` page
* Let it scroll fully
* Try the auto-scroll mode first
* Helix/live detection is separate from fetching your follow list

### Tabs close and reopen unexpectedly

This should be better than in older builds, but Twitch can still be weird sometimes.

* Check Diagnostics/logs to see if Twitch returned an empty or inconsistent result
* Make sure manual Twitch tabs are not confusing the manager
* Try **Force Poll** again after a short wait

## FAQ

### Can it run without tokens?

Yes, but Helix is more reliable.

### Does it close my own manually opened Twitch tabs?

It should not. Only manager-opened tabs are supposed to be auto-closed.

### Can I keep certain channels preferred?

Yes. Use `priority`.

### Can it always force hidden tabs to play with sound?

Not perfectly. Browser autoplay/background restrictions still apply, so some cases need retries or a future soft-wake fallback.

### Where is my data stored?

Settings, follows, and related extension state are stored locally in your browser. Exported files such as `config.json` or `follows.txt` are only created when you choose to export them.
